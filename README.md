⏱️ Time Series Forecasting Project
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting future values based on historical time-series data. The goal is to understand patterns such as trends, seasonality, and anomalies, and build a reliable predictive model to support data-driven decision-making.
🎯 Key Objectives
Analyze historical data to identify trends and seasonal patterns
Perform data cleaning, resampling, and feature engineering
Build forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM
Compare model performance and select the best-performing approach
Generate visual insights and future predictions

📊 Tools & Techniques
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Statsmodels, Facebook Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras
Time-series decomposition, ACF/PACF, hyperparameter tuning

🚀 Results
Achieved accurate short-term and long-term forecasts
Visualized model predictions vs. actual observations
Delivered insights to support planning and decision-making
